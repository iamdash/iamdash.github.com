			<p>Focussing on Javascript development, recent times have seen me working on projects for a variety of high-profile clients. This has included HTML5 games for the BBC,
			   a hybrid tablet app for Tesco, and AngularJS-based apps for Cathay Pacific, Lufthansa and Manchester City Football Club.</p>

			<h2>Highlighted projects:</h2>

			<h3>GTS Football Scouting app</h3>
			<p>A hybrid mobile app developed for and distributed by football clubs at all levels (including the Premier League) to their talent scouts to allow them to create and submit reports on players. A bespoke AngularJS-based management system which sat on top of a NodeJS/Express API was developed alongside the app to manage player reports and scouts.</span></p>

			<h3>Malls by Tesco tablet app</h3>
			<p>A hybrid tablet app built on top of a Wordpress backend for use by the Malls by Tesco retail team whilst out on the road at exhibitions and events. The app includes photo galleries, a number of case studies and an interactive map that allows the user to view details on over 400 mall locations across Central and Eastern Europe.</span>

			<h3>Cathay Pacific In-flight digital portal, Dragonair Studio<sup>KA</sup> and Lufthansa FlyNet<sup>&copy;</sup></h3>

			<p>As part of a team at Black Swan Data and working with Panasonic Avionics in Orange County, I helped develop several AngularJS-based wifi-based entertainment portals that are accessed by airline passengers on mobile phones, tablets and laptops. </p>


			<h3>Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide To The Galaxy (HG2G) 30th Anniversary Game</h3>

			<p>Working with BBC Radio 4&rsquo;s content team and a team of server-side engineers, I developed a Javascript update to the BBC&rsquo;s 20th Anniversary HG2G online game. The game was nominated in the &ldquo;Best Collaboration&rdquo; category at the 2015 BBC Radio Awards. The project also has a bit of an interesting back story, which you can read about

			</p>

			<h3>Collective Narrative Timeline Platform</h3>

			<p>Originally developed for Manchester City Football Club, I built the front-end of a user-generated-content timeline for
				<a href="http://collectivenarrative.co">Collective Narrative</a> using AngularJS.
			   The timeline is currently being used by <a

				<a href="http://www.pompeyvoices.co.uk">Portsmouth FC</a> and
